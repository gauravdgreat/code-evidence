## **👨‍💻 About Me**  

Hi, my name is **Gaurav Choudhary**, and I started my journey as a **Full-Time Junior Software Engineer**. The primary reason for creating this repository is to demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers, proving that I can deliver more than just the basics.  

But it's not just about impressing employers — it's also about sharing my knowledge, experiences, and insights that I gather along this journey. I believe that learning is a continuous process, and this repo is my way of documenting that growth.
